  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to create a CMS-style blog. This blog would allow developers to publish blog posts and comment on other developer's posts. The languages used for this project are CSS, JavaScript, and HTML using Handlebars.     Difficulties came with the editing feature of the blog post, and getting everything to flow together.
